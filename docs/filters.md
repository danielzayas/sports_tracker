Now, let's make changes to the page filters. 

## Remove features

Filtering is not working by team or by individual. Remove both. Keep the feature to filter by sport. 

## Update feature

Filterting by sport only supports filtering by one specific league. Instead:
- it should support filtering out a specific league (e.g. exclude "MLB")
- it should support a filter that includs multiple leagues (e.g. include "Men's NCAA College Basketball" and "Women's NCAA College Basketball")
- the name of the filter should be "By League" or similar
